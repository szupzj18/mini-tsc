# mini-tsc

> ✨ A minimal TypeScript compiler for learning and experimentation.

mini-tsc is a lightweight implementation of a TypeScript compiler that parses .ts files, performs basic type checking, and outputs JavaScript code. This project is educational in nature, aiming to explore the internals of the TypeScript compilation process.

## Feature ( to be done ⚡)

- Tokenizer: Converts raw TypeScript code into a stream of tokens.

- Parser: Transforms tokens into a structured abstract syntax tree (AST).

- Type Checker: Performs basic static analysis, such as scope validation, type inference, and function signature checks.

- Source map support
